# B.C. Government Information Technology Architectural Guidance

## Introduction 

The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)'s Enterprise Architecture team creates architectural practices for ministries across government product teams. Our goal for best practices is modern, cost effective, and standardize across B.C. Government. The outcome we strive for is human-centric digital services for B.C. residents.

We co-created our repository and documents with B.C. Government Architects. These guidelines help with architectural decision making for developing and keeping compliant, usable, and resilient products in both private and public cloud.

## Enterprise Architecture (EA)

The Enterprise Architecture function within each function helps to understand and build cohesion between the various other roles and layers in the enterprise. Besides enterprise architectural units that may exist within each enterprise, BC Gov also has a central architectural team from the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) who are responsible to help foster the enterprise architectural teams within each enterprise as well as break the siloes between various enterprises within BC Gov to promote collaborative use of technology and adopt reusable technology where possible to reduce costs.

The four pillars of the central EA function are:

### Enterprise Architects and Architects

Information Technology Architecture is the structural design and behaviour of multiple components and subsystems in an organization. It uses various distinct practices. 

Across government, we have numerous architectural roles, all of whom have different functions. Our team is 'Enterprise Architect' because our work interweaves into other ministries and agencies. In comparison [generic example of other architects roles].

To comprehend the diversity of architects, let's look at government as an enterprise. We have: 

* 23 Ministries
* 12 Central Agencies
* 29 Crown Corporations
* 34 Independent Boards and tribunals

All entities use adaptive technology and needs regulation via governance, standards, and policies. Each entity is further defined by its business, data, applications, technology and security. 

Focusing on the architects, there are 13 different roles:

* Technical Architects
* Technology Architects
* System Architects
* Security Architects
* Application Architects
* DevOps Specialists
* Full Stack Developers
* Data Architects
* Information Architects
* Cloud Architects
* Solution Architects
* Business Architects
* Enterprise Architects.
