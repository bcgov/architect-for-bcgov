# AI Development Life Cycle

## 1. Planning Phase

### Determine the business objectives and requirements.

### Determine the scope of the project.

### Determine the governance structure and responsibilities.

## 2. AI System Design

### Implement a data strategy that includes:

#### Data gathering, wrangling, cleansing, labeling.

#### Applying PETs like anonymization, minimization, differential privacy, federated

### Determine Al system architecture and model selection (choose the algorithm according to the desired level of accuracy and interpretability).

## 3. System Development

### Build the model.

### Perform feature engineering.

### Perform model training.

### Perform model testing and validation.

## 4. System Implementation

### Perform readiness assessments.

### Deploy the model into production.

### Monitor and validate the model.

### Maintain the model.
