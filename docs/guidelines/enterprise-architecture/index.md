Welcome to the official website of the OCIO's Enterprise Architecture Team. 

Information Technology Architecture is the structural design and behaviour of multiple components and subsystems within an organization. It is composed of various distinct practices such as:

**Technology Architecture**: Technology Architecture deals with the design of technology infrastructure such as network, storage and compute.

**Application Architecture**: Application Architecture is the design of applications, products and services that are used by end users. There are several types of application architectures such as microservices based architecture, service-oriented architecture, event driven architecture, client server model archietcture, server achitecture, space based architecture, component based software architecture, peer-to-pper architecture, three-tier architecture, microkernel architecture, monolithic architecture, broker pattern architecture, shared-nothing architecture.

**Data Architecture**: Data Architecture describes how data is managed across various phases such as collection, transformation, distribution and consumption. It sets a blueprint for how the data flows through data storage systems and deals with designs of data models, structures and integrations.

**Information Architecture**: Infomation Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, labeling, navigation and search of information in an organization in an effective and sustainable way.

**Systems Architecture**: Systems Architecture focus on how systems and services align with business objectives and provide the best value proposition to the end users.

**Solution Architecture**: Solution Architecture is an architectural description, support and maintenance of a specific business solution.

**Information Security Architecture**: Information Security Architecture provides an analysis of information security at a structural level and develops principles, controls, policies, processes and standards related to Information Security.

**Specialists**: Specialists address architecture in terms of specialized domains or technologies such as cloud architects, devops specialists, devops architects, automation architects etc.

**Business Architecture**: Business Architecture performs the design of business structures and provides an analysis of business capabilities, gaps between capabilities and strategy as well as a roadmap for future capabilities.

**Enterprise Architecture**: Enterprise Architecture defines the foundational principles, platforms, models and standards to be used by an entire organization.

**IT Governance**: IT Governance aligns changes to business strategy and enterprise architecture and provides an oversight into IT strategy and change. The team responsible for IT Governance has the authority to provision/stop funding.

**IT Risk Management**: IT Risk Management is the process of identifying and managing IT risks with architectural analysis.

## Why Enterprise Architecture?

Do the following questions resonate with you?

- What digital services do other teams across the Government of British Columbia offer?
- What are ways in which I can save costs or what are other teams doing to provide cost effective services to the residents of British Columbia?
- Where do I go to learn about reusable components I can use to build my product instead of starting from scratch?
- I have no developers on my team, are there similar teams across the Government of British Columbia? What do they offer?
- Who helps decides what is the best technology to invest in and how can they help to maximize the return on investment?
- Who helps evaluate if products or services help meet the mandate and goals of each ministry?

While solution architects and technical architects focus on developing the right architecture for the product teams, enterprise architects focus on the bigger picture and how each product, service, investement bring value to the end users as well as to the enterprise at large. While public servants across government are working to deliver excellent digital services that are simple, modern and focused on user needs, we as Enterprise Architects are working to ensure you as public servants get access to the best advice around how to invest in the right technology space to deliver these services.

We have four major priorities as the Enterprise Architecture.

**Support** : We offer support to ministry teams at various levels on what is the best way to deliver digital services and products. This may seem broad and support ranges from moral support to technical support. Yes, you can approach us with an idea that we can help shape or you can approach us with a technical issue you are running into.

**Ecosystem**: We are working on building a knowledge base of understanding the ecosystem of the Government of British Columbia. This work is possible only because of the excellent work each ministry is doing to understand their ecosystem. We believe it is our job to put all the pieces together and solve the puzzle for government as an enterprise. 

**Governance**: We are working on helping prioritize funding requests and ecosystem knowledge would help us identify these priorities and products that deliver value.

**Community**: We are striving to develop meaningful communities within the Government of British Columbia to help foster a culture of breaking silos and working together in public service delivery.
