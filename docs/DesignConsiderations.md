Design Considerations for an Application

Notes : In this context, an "application" may be substituted by "service" and many consideration would still apply, though they could have different implementations (ie, of the similar capability).

# Shaping your application

**Audience**	metadata factors: where is the audience geographically?  what is the overall size of the audience?  what is the expected peak concurrent audience engaged with app?  On what devices?

**Application Redundancy** Related to Business Continuity, this is an implementation detail that addresses continued availability of applications that are very important to the business in case of failure of one or more parts of either the underlying infrastructure, other applications or services upon which an applications depends, or parts of the application itself.

**Business Continuity** How important is this application to its audience?  What expectations does its audience have of its availability?  How easily can the business purpose of the application be accomplished without it?  What contingencies are in place for business to continue when the application becomes unavailable?  See also Application Deployment.)

**Legislation, Policy, & Standards** Population considerations like indigenous language support, methods for implementing a Data Register, consumption of Common Components (and other de facto standard ways of doing something.)
