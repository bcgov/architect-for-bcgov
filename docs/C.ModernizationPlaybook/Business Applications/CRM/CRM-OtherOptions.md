# Other CRM Platforms

## Opensource CRM
 <br />
 Propreitary CRM solutions are finalized products which mostly require a subscription. If you rather customize and modify the CRM solution to suit your needs, it is best to choose an free and open souce CRM solution.

 Several OpenSource solutions are available in the market too. Though there are a few opensource CRM solutions that are available as SaaS, most of these solutions are available to be consumed in the form of source code and would require a team of developers to implement the solution on on-prem or cloud infrastructure and maintain the same.

 Some of the opensource CRM solutions are given below:

### HubSpot CRM

## Serverless Options
<br />
 Deploying a CRM solution on Cloud as opposed to hosting one on prem has the following benefits:

  1. There would be no underlying hardware or infrastructure or maintain
  2. Ensure high availability and resilience
  3. There would be tighter integrations with other cloud products
  4. It would be easier and faster to implement a CRM solution on cloud
  5. The CRM applications would be highly scalable on cloud

  In order to further reduce costs, you can make use of Functions as a Service (FaaS) to execute tasks which happen less frequently in order to save cloud resources. 
  
  For example, Approvals and Consents on Applications might not happen very frequently. It would be best to trigger these operations as serverless functions when these events are triggered.
