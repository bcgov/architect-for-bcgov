OCIO - Enterprise Architecture

This repository is actively managed by the OCIO Enterprise Architecture Team. The contents will soon be hosted on (DevHub)[http://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca]. This repository contains various folders namely:

1. .diagrams - This folder contains the xml versions of the draw.io diagrams and is a space for contributors to contribute to our diagrams. This folder also contains diagrams that are actively under development and is the staging space for the work we are pursuing on drawio.

2. assets - This folder contains the miscellaneous assets that are internal to the EA's content hosting requirements.

3. definitions - This folder contains definitions and can be treated as an appendix/dictionary of terms that are used in our docs/pictures.

4. docs - This folder contains documents that are pointers/guidelines/best practices or reference architectures from across BC Gov. These documents will be published on  (DevHub)[http://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca].

5. pictures - These are a more user friendly versions or editable png versions of the xml diagram files. This folder is considered as the production space for our diagrams, that is, once the EA has completed the diagrams, they would be converted to pictures and stored in this folder. Pull requests can still be submitted if contributors have changes.
